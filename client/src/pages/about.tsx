          <p>
            Welcome to Pravaah, where artistry meets craftsmanship. Our journey began 
            with a simple belief: that handcrafted items carry a special kind of magic, 
            one that mass-produced goods can never replicate.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Pravaah means "flow" in Sanskrit, and it represents our philosophy of 
            creating products that seamlessly blend into your daily life while adding 
            a touch of artisanal beauty. Each piece we create is carefully handcrafted 
            with attention to detail and love for the craft.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Products</h2>
          <p>
            From delicate silk scrunchies to aromatic hand-poured candles, from 
            intricate beaded accessories to personalized collage posters, every item 
            in our collection tells a story. We use only the finest materials and 
            time-honored techniques to create pieces that are both beautiful and durable.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
          <p>
            We believe in sustainable crafting practices and supporting local artisans. 
            Every purchase you make helps support our community of skilled craftspeople 
            and ensures the continuation of traditional crafting techniques.
